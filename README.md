# click-event-element-highlight-jquery
This frontend script enables users to click certain buttons to have other elements light up. It is a useful UI/UX script if you are displaying categories for your user to click and potentially interact with.

The way it works is that you have a defined CSS class for these elements, as well as a go-transparent class. In your HTML, you will add an index (as defined in the global variable) to each element that will have the 'go-transparent' class applied when clicked.
